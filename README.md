This is a set of configurations and scripts I like to use on linux.
If there is anything you like, feel free to adapt and use in your setup!

The following notes are mostly for personal reference

* The distro is Ubuntu MATE 22.10 
* The terminal and neovim colorscheme is base-16-default-dark
* The terminal font is the Ubuntu NerdFont

* `base-16-default-dark.vim` happily lives in the `.config/nvim/colors` folder as I use it consistently and don't have a need for every other theme in the `base16-vim` plugin. I've also tweaked it slightly to get the line number background to match the editor background

* some of my zsh aliases have been creatively borrowed from my friend Philipp who is definitely very awesome

* I use `oh-my-zsh`
