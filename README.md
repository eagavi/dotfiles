# dotfiles

This is a set of configurations and scripts I like to use on linux.
If there is anything you like, feel free to adapt to your taste and use in your setup!

The following notes are mostly for personal reference

* The distro is Ubuntu MATE 22.10 
* The terminal and neovim colorscheme are from `dark-plus-syntax` and the default Visual Studio Code theme respectively

* The terminal font is the Ubuntu NerdFont

* some of my zsh aliases have been creatively borrowed from my friend Philipp who is definitely very awesome

* I use `oh-my-zsh`

* I prefer to use fzf to find and open files


vs code :

    `"workbench.colorCustomizations": {
        "[dark-plus-syntax]": {
            "activityBar.background": "#191919",
            "activityBar.activeBorder": "#191919",
            "sideBar.background": "#202020",
            "sideBarSectionHeader.background": "#191919",
            "statusBar.background": "#202020"
        }
    },`
