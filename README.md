This is a set of configurations and scripts I like to use on linux.
If there is anything you like, feel free to adapt to your taste and use in your setup!

I use Ubuntu MATE 22.10


vs code :

    `"workbench.colorCustomizations": {
        "[dark-plus-syntax]": {
            "activityBar.background": "#191919",
            "activityBar.activeBorder": "#191919",
            "sideBar.background": "#202020",
            "sideBarSectionHeader.background": "#191919",
            "statusBar.background": "#202020"
        }
    },`
